Deploy to GitHub Pages: Run the mkdocs gh-deploy command in the terminal. \u27a4 This command creates a gh-pages branch, adds the compiled site to it, and pushes it to GitHub. \u27a4 The generated URL will look like this: https://[username].github.io/[repository-name] Step 9: Edit the Appearance of Your Site Create the extra.css file in the docs folder. Register your custom CSS in the mkdocs.yml configuration file. Add your custom styles to the extra.css file. For example, in my case: ```css / Header styles / .navbar.bg-primary { background-image: none !important; background-color: #2d6da7 !important; } / Removing the default footer / footer { display: none !important; } / Styles for the navigation bar / .navbar .nav-link { color: #F8F9FA !important; / Text color for the navigation bar / } .navbar .nav-link:hover { color: #d3d9dA !important; / Hover text color for the navigation bar / } 4. Write in our configuration (mkdocs.yml) the styling theme (in my case, it is \u201cmkdocs\u201d) and localization (for example, ru). \u27a4 Localization is written to translate default elements, for example, pagination. Step 10: Committing Sources and Sending to the Git Repository Follow these commands in sequence: Adding files to the staging area: git add . This command adds all files and changes in the current directory (indicated by the . ) to the staging area. It means you tell Git which files should be included in the next commit. If you need to add files from a specific folder (e.g., docs ), use: git add docs/ or git add ./docs The choice depends on your preference, but both are valid. 2. Creating a commit with a message: git commit -m \"Description of changes\" * This command saves the changes from the staging area to the repository with a message. * If you don't use the -m flag, Git will open a text editor for you to write the description manually. Example: git commit -m \"Added documentation files\" 3. Pushing changes to the remote repository: git push origin main - This command sends (pushes) changes from your local repository to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub). - origin is the name of the remote repository (default). - main is the name of the branch where the changes are pushed. If your branch is named differently (e.g., master ), replace main with the name of your branch. Now you can view the committed changes by visiting the following link: GitHub Repository Adjustments Made: 1. Explained the meaning of the dot (.) as a reference to the current directory. 2.

In the window that appears, enter the filename mkdocs.yml . \u27a4 To create a Yaml file, just add the .yml extension to the file name. Add the file to Git. \u27a4 After this step, you will have a mkdocs.yml file in your project tree. Step 6: Create Documentation in Markdown Format Create a docs folder for storing the source text files. Create an image folder for storing images. As a result, your project structure will be scalable and look like this: Web-docs/ # Parent directory \u251c\u2500\u2500 .venv/ # Virtual environment of the project \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ # Documentation source files \u251c\u2500\u2500 image/ # Documentation images \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml # MkDocs configuration file Next, within the docs folder, create your first Markdown file. \u27a4 To create a Markdown file, just add the .md extension to the filename and start adding content according to the rules described below. Basics of writing text in Markdown Markdown is a simple markup language for formatting text. It allows you to create structured text using simple symbols. Here are the main features: Headings Use the # symbol to create headings of different levels. The more # symbols, the lower the heading level. Example: ```markdown # Heading Level 1 ## Heading Level 2 ### Heading Level 3 Paragraphs and Line Breaks To separate paragraphs, leave a blank line. To force a line break, add two spaces at the end of a line. Example: This is the first paragraph. This is the second paragraph. And this is the second line without a paragraph. Text Formatting Bold: Wrap text in double asterisks ( ) or double underscores (__). Example:** **Bold text** __Bold text__ Italics: Wrap text in single asterisks ( ) or single underscores (_). Example: * *Italics* _Italics_ Strikethrough: Use double tildes (~~). Example: ~~Strikethrough text~~ Lists Bulleted list: Use -, , or +. Example: * - Item 1 - Item 2 - Sub-item ``` * Numbered list: Use numbers with a period. **Example:** ```markdown 1. First 2. Second Links [Link text](URL) Images ![Image name](../image/1_structure_project.png) \u27a4 To add an image, you don\u2019t need to specify the path manually. Just drag the image from the left menu to the desired location, and PyCharm will automatically generate the path. \u27a4 PyCharm has three document display modes, including a preview with images. 7. Code * Inline code: Wrap the text in backticks (`). Example: `python -m venv .venv` Code block: Wrap the text in triple backticks (`````) followed by the language. Example: ```print(\"Hello, World!\")``` Tables Create tables using vertical bars (|) and hyphens (-). Example: | Heading 1 | Heading 2 | |-----------|-----------| | Text 1 | Text 2 | Note Use the > symbol to create notes. Example: > Note: Always test your code before deploying. In some cases, the numbering may be broken. To fix this, I use HTML to continue the numbering: <ol start=\"5\"> <li>Links:</li> <a href=\"URL\">Link text</a> </ol> Step 7: Complete the Structure of Your Project In the source folder, create the file index.md \u2014 the text of this document will be displayed on the home page of the site. Create the .gitignore file in the root of the project and write site in it \u2014 this will prevent Git from tracking the compiled files. \u27a4 The \"site\" folder will be automatically generated during deployment.
